Continuing with iOS development, I decided to create a sample application that would display match day scores from the World Cup 2018 in Russia.

**WorldCup App** runs on externally loaded data and displays its contents with a combination of a UITableView and a UICollectionView. This application has a lot of things going in the background so be sure to check out the source. If you want to extend this application or have any comments about this just let me know :D

The actual JSON data used in this application can be found here: https://github.com/openfootball if you ever need information about anything football... this is the place :D

Lastly, I can't take full credit for the visual design of this application. I was inspired by the very talented Burhanudin Yusuf (@ucupsaklek)

Check out samples of his work on Dribbble https://dribbble.com/ucupsaklek

## WorldCup App features:
 - Load/display external data
 - Data driven application
 - UITableViewCell Transitions
 - Imported Fonts
 - Programmatically applied auto layout within cells

**WorldCup App** uses **Swift 4.1.2 - Xcode 9.4.1**
